-- Switches: picking the same activity back up after a short gap is one flow, not a change of activity.
-- Until now recompute_daily_analytics counted every pair of runs less than 30 minutes apart as a switch, so A, a one-block
-- gap, A scored a switch. The TypeScript profile (src/lib/analysis.ts profileDays) and the Patterns tab already treat it as
-- one flow; this brings the stored analytics_daily.switches / cross_switches in line with them.
--
-- Only the two is_switch / cross-switch conditions change; the rest of the function is byte-for-byte the previous version
-- (20261004100000_routine_analytics). The signature and return type are unchanged, so create or replace is enough.
-- analytics_daily is derived data: after applying, rebuild it with rebuild_analytics_range over the real date range.

create or replace function public.recompute_daily_analytics(p_user_id uuid, p_date date)
